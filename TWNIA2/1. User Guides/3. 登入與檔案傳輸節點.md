TWCC also provides users transferring data with the `rsync` command, which offers a good experience when transferring large amounts of files. However, TWCC does not support recording the transfer log using `rsync`, so you cannot track problems when you have security concerns. If you agree to bear the risk and authorize TWCC to enable `rsync` function, please contact <ins><a href="isupport@twcc.ai"></a>isupport@twcc.ai</ins>.
