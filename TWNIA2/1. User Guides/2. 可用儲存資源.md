# Available storage resources

Compute nodes access [Hyper File System (HFS)](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/doc-hfs-main-en) via high-speed network. HFS is petabyte(PB)-level storage space, it provides high-throughput I/O for large files, quickly access and operate each data, and brings a grear user experience.


| Storage directory | Mount point | Free space capacity per user |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Home directory    | /home     |  100 GB :free: |
| Temporary work directory     | /work     |  100 GB :free:|


## Home directory - /home

In home directory, users can store private files, edit scripts, execute and manage computing jobs. After signing in a TWCC account, each user gets a default quota of 100 GB of free space available under /home directory.


## Temporary work directory - /work

Temporary work directory is mainly used to store temporary data during the user's computing process. After signing in a TWCC account, each user gets a default quota of 100 GB of free space available under /work directory.

This space is designed for computing jobs, not for long-term storage. In order to maintain a stable and efficient state of /work directory, TWCC will clean the space periodically and automatically.
