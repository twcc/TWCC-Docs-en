# HowTo: Access Cloud Object Storage (COS)

:::success
<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Case senario: How to access file in COS through Taiwania 2 (HPC CLI)?**

*Do you have the same problem? Let us take you hand in hand to assemble the TWCC cloud service architecture to easily solve your problems!*
:::

[TWCC TWNIA2 (HPC CLI)](https://www.twcc.ai/doc?page=hpc_cli) other than able to use [Hyper File System (HFS)](https://www.twcc.ai/doc?page=hfs) as storage space for computing, also able to store less accessed static data in [TWCC Cloud Object Storage (COS)](https://www.twcc.ai/doc?page=object).

This article will demonstrate two method to access file in [TWCC Cloud Object Storage (COS)](https://www.twcc.ai/doc?page=object) through  TWNIA2 (HPC CLI):

1. **S3 client tools**
    User able to upload and download files via HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) when **Login node** and **submitting a job to the computing node**.

2. **Mounted as a network hard drive**
    Using [FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace) technology to remotely mount COS storage space as a network hard drive, **Only able to mounted on Login node** (ln01.twcc.ai).

:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:**
It is recommended to use **S3 client tools**:

- Due to mount COS using FUSE technology is not the actual local machine file system, in order to prevent data lost, users are **only able to upload single file** (multiple files to be read and download are accepted).
- It's also have [<ins>Many restrictions</ins>](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse#limitations), so it's only provided for users to use on Login node.
:::

You may choose either of it according to your needs, below demontrate two methods to use it. 

## 1. S3 client tools

There are many types of S3 client tools. The tools introduced below are mainly using CLI operation. You may choose to use them according to your needs. The example will use `TWCC CLI` and `S3cmd` to access COS data:
- **[S3cmd](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd)** 
  Written in Python language. It has been developed early and has complete and stable functions. It is one of the most well-known S3 CLI tools.
- **[TWCC CLI](https://github.com/TW-NCHC/TWCC-CLI)** 
  If you are already familiar with TWCC CLI, you may consider to use it and operate multiple TWCC services.
- Other tools
    - **[Rclone](https://github.com/rclone/rclone)**: 
  Able to connect to multiple cloud storage space. Suitable for the transfer of small files between TWCC TWNIA2 (HPC CLI) and COS.
    - **[S5cmd](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd)**: 
    Written in GO language, the transmission speed is faster than the tool written in Python, but the function is not as complete as S3cmd.


### Installtion and Settings

- Accessing TWCC COS required **Access Key** and **Secret Key**. Please login to [TWCC portal](https://www.twcc.ai/) > COS to obtain it.
- Enter the **Third Party Software** page of `Cloud Object Storage (Shared storage space between project members)` or `Private COS (private storage space)` to obtain the key information.

#### S3cmd
- **Install**
```bash
# Using pip to install
$ pip install s3cmd --user
```
- **Enter key**
```bash
# In here using vim as an example, you may use your familiar editor to edit ~/.s3cfg
$ vim ~/.s3cfg
```

```bash
# Edit content
-----------------------
# Setup endpoint
host_base = cos.twcc.ai
host_bucket = cos.twcc.ai
use_https = True

# Setup access keys
access_key = <COS Access Key>
secret_key = <COS Secret Key>
-----------------------
```

#### TWCC CLI
- **Install**
```bash
# Using pip to install
$ pip3 install TWCC-CLI --user
```
- For **How to enter key, select projects, enter TWCC CLI environment, see [TWCC CLI document](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/twcc-cli-v05#1-3-%E9%80%B2%E5%85%A5-TWCC_CLI-%E7%92%B0%E5%A2%83%E4%B8%A6%E9%96%8B%E5%A7%8B%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%9C%8D%E5%8B%99)** for more information.


<!-- #### MCLI
- **安裝**

已預先裝於台灣杉二號，使用以下指令載入工具即可。

```bash
$ module load mcli
```

- **寫入金鑰**

加入金鑰，指令及參考範例如下。

```bash
$ mcli config host add twcc https://cos.twcc.ai <COS Access Key> <COS Secret Key>
``` -->

### Operation example

Each example shows the operation method of using the commands `S3cmd` and `TWCC CLI` in order.

- **Create a bucket named `mytwccbucket`**
  
```bash
# for S3cmd
$ s3cmd mb s3://mytwccbucket

# for TWCC CLI
$ twccli mk cos -bkt mytwccbucket
```

- **Upload file**

Create a empty folder in /home directory named `myfile`
  
```bash
$ touch ~/myfile
```
Copy file to `mytwccbucket` bucket
  
```bash
# for S3cmd
$ s3cmd put ~/myfile s3://mytwccbucket/

# for TWCC CLI
$ twccli cp cos -bkt mytwccbucket -fn myfile -sync to-cos
```
- **View file**

Check if the upload is successful
```bash
# for S3cmd
$ s3cmd ls s3://mytwccbucket/myfile

# for TWCC CLI
$ twccli ls cos -bkt mytwccbucket
```
- **Delte file**

Delete the just uploaded myfile
```bash
# for S3cmd
$ s3cmd rm s3://mytwccbucket/myfile

# for TWCC CLI
$ twccli rm cos -bkt mytwccbucket -okey myfile
```
- **Delete bucket**

Please make sure the bucket is empty before deleting bucket

```bash
# for S3cmd
$ s3cmd rb s3://mytwccbucket

# for TWCC CLI
$ twccli rm cos -bkt mytwccbucket
```

## 2. Mount

The following will introduce two mounting tools: [Goofys](https://github.com/kahing/goofys) and [S3fs](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse), you may choose according to your needs.

:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** The mounting method only able to used on ln01.twcc.ai login node.
:::


### Create a COS bucket

- Please refer to TWCC [Cloud Object Storage](https://www.twcc.ai/doc?page=object) manual and create a COS bucket on portal (The management of Bucket cannot operate through TWNIA2).
- Create a `~/mount_cos` folder after login to ln01.twcc.ai:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/mount_cos
```


### Enter key

Create a folder under `~/.aws` directory, and copy TWCC COS key to `~/.aws/credentials`.


In here using vim as an example, you may use your familiar editor.

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.aws
$ vim ~/.aws/credentials
```

Enter the content below:

```bash
[default]
aws_access_key_id = COS Access Key
aws_secret_access_key = COS Secret Key
```


### [Goofys](https://github.com/kahing/goofys) 
- Written in Go language, good performance, should have a high priority.


Mount command:
```bash
$ goofys --endpoint https://cos.twcc.ai mytwccbucket ~/mount_cos
```

### [S3fs](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse)
- S3fs is a well-known s3 mounting tool.

Mount command:

```bash
$ s3fs mytwccbucket ~/mount_s3 -o url=https://cos.twcc.ai/ -o use_path_request_style
```

### Access method

After the mount is completed, you may access to the new created COS `mytwccbucket` file under the `~/mount_cos` directory.

Example of operation

```bash
# Write into an empty file named myfile
$ touch ~/mount_cos/myfile
```
At this time, you may click on `mytwccbucket` on **Cloud Object Storage Management** webpage to view the content of the file `myfile`.


### Unmount

Please exit the mounted folder and back to  /home directory.

```bash
$ cd ~/
```

Enter unmount command.

```bash
$ fusermount -u ~/mount_cos
```

Enter the command below. The unmount is completed if there are no files listed. 

```bash
$ ls ~/mount_cos
```
