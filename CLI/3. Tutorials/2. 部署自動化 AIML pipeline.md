# HowTo：Deploy automated AI/ML pipeline using TWCC CLI

:::success
<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Case scenario:Is there a set of workflows that can automatically create containers, perform model training, and delete containers?**
*Do you have the same problem? Let us take you hand in hand to assemble the TWCC cloud service architecture to easily solve your problems!*
:::

This article will help users understand how to use the TWCC CLI and a Virtual Compute Service(VCS) to concatenate the following tasks into an automated process (pipeline), improve work efficiency, and save the cost of continuous container opening:

```
1. Create Container
2. Training Container
3. Delete Container
```

By deploying a pipeline to connect TWCC resources, you can hand over manual tasks to script to automate until completion. The arrangement of time and manpower will be more flexible, **and the resources will be automatically deleted after the program is executed, and the cost of the computing will be lowered.**


## Environment deployment

The example in this article will use the TWCC Virtual Compute Service as the local host. The TWCC CLI has been installed for the user, which can quickly execute the automated management process of deploying the container. You can also install the TWCC CLI on your own computer.

:::

### Step 1. Create Virtual Computing Instance
Following [Create Virtual Computing Instance](https://www.twcc.ai/doc?page=vm#%E5%BB%BA%E7%AB%8B%E8%99%9B%E6%93%AC%E9%81%8B%E7%AE%97%E5%80%8B%E9%AB%94), create a virtual computing instance on the portal website, please refer to the following for settings:

```
Image：Ubuntu 20.04
Basic settings：v.super
```

### Step 2. Enable TWCC CLI

Please refer [1-3. Enter TWCC_CLI environment and start using service](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/twcc-cli-v05#1-3-%E9%80%B2%E5%85%A5-TWCC_CLI-%E7%92%B0%E5%A2%83%E4%B8%A6%E9%96%8B%E5%A7%8B%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%9C%8D%E5%8B%99) to enable TWCC CLI.

### Step 3. Install jq
jq is a processing tool in JSON format. TWCC CLI data can be converted to JSON format to show, and some data can be intercepted by jq for application. Related documents can be referred to [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/).

-Enter the following command to install jq：
```bash
$ sudo apt install jq
```



## SSH Without Password

Generally, SSH connection needs to insert the key or enter the password to log in, so the automated process will stop and cannot continue.

Use the following method to create a container and send the SSH key of the Virtual Computing Instance to the container. After that, you can skip the action of inserting the key or entering the password and log in to the container directly.

### Step 1. Create SSH key
- Enter the following command to create SSH key
```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -n 4096
```

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to skip the following three questions

```bash
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```

- Enter the following command to create a Interactive Container

```bash
$ twccli mk ccs -gpu 1
```


### Step 2. Insert SSH key to Interactive Container
- Enter the following command to insert SSH key to Interactive Container

```bash
$ ssh-copy-id <USERNAME>@<CCS_IP> -p <PORT>

#<USERNAME>:supercomputer account
#<CCS_IP>:Public IP address of the Interactive Container
#<PORT>:Container SSH's open port
```

- To insert the key in the container for the first time, you need to enter the **supercomputer password**. After the completion of the Virtual Computing Instance, the container will no longer need to enter the password:

### Step 3. Download the sample program:GPU Burn 

This article uses the GPU Burn program as an operating example. You can refer to the following steps to load the required model training program after entering the container environment, or directly [Using SFTP + Filezilla ](https://www.twcc.ai/doc?page=hfs#%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-SFTP--Filezilla-%E5%82%B3%E8%BC%B8%E6%AA%94%E6%A1%88) to upload the program to the container default storage space - Hyper File System.

- Enter the following command to enter the container environment
```bash
$ ssh <USERNAME>@<CCS_IP> -p <PORT>

#<USERNAME>:supercomputer account
#<CCS_IP>:Public IP address of the Interactive Container
#<PORT>:Container SSH's open port
```

- Download the sample program:GPU Burn
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wilicc/gpu-burn.git
```

- Compile the program into usable command (may be omitted)

```bash
$ cd gpu-burn
$ make >> progress.log 2>&1
```

- Exit the container and return to the Virtual Computing Instance environment
 
```bash
$ exit
```

- After completing the above actions, you can delete the container used in the deployment environment. Please list all containers first and find out the container ID
 
```bash
$ twccli ls ccs
```

![](https://cos.twcc.ai/SYS-MANUAL/uploads/upload_fdc83baa8f0a580a72f1bb4935802ba2.png)



- Delete the container of the deployment environment
```bash
$ twccli rm ccs -f -s <SITE_ID>  

#<SITE_ID>：Container ID
```

The deployment environment and loading execution program are complete! Then you can start to make and execute scripts that automatically create containers, perform computing, and delete containers.

## AI/ML pipeline script
The  automated AI/ML pipeline script can be divided into 5 steps:

1. Create: Create container computing resources.
2. Put Data: Upload related files to the container.
3. Execution: Execute the program.
4. Collect Data: Collect the results of progam execution.
5. Garbage Collection: Recycle used computing resources.

Please refer to the steps below to create and execute a pipeline script.

### Step 1. Create pipeline script
- Enter the following command to edit pipeline script:
```bash
$ vi AI_ML.sh
```
- Enter `i` to enter the editing mode, and paste the following example script into `AI_ML.sh`. The content can be modified according to your computing program, and you can also choose to create a larger container.

```bash
TWCC_CLI_CMD=/usr/local/bin/twccli

echo "1. Creating CCS" #Create Interactive Container
$TWCC_CLI_CMD mk ccs -gpu 1 -wait -json > ccs_res.log

CCS_ID=$(cat ccs_res.log | jq '.id')
echo "2. CCS ID:" $CCS_ID #Interactive Container's ID

echo "3. Checking GPU" #Viewing GPU status
ssh -t -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" `$TWCC_CLI_CMD ls ccs -gssh -s $CCS_ID` "/bin/bash --login -c nvidia-smi"

echo "4. RUN GPU" #Executing computing program
ssh -t -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" `$TWCC_CLI_CMD ls ccs -gssh -s $CCS_ID` "cd gpu-burn;/bin/bash --login -c './gpu_burn 150'"
#You may modified "cd gpu-burn;/bin/bash --login -c './gpu_burn 150'" according to your program.

echo "5. GC GPU" #Delete Interactive Container
$TWCC_CLI_CMD rm ccs -f -s $CCS_ID

echo "6. Checking CCS" #View container status
$TWCC_CLI_CMD ls ccs
```
- Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> key and enter `:wq!` to save.

:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** 
* Step **echo "4. RUN GPU"** You may modifired this part of script `"cd gpu-burn;/bin/bash --login -c './gpu_burn 150'"` according to your program.
:::


### Step 2. Execute pipeline script

- Enter the following command to execute pipeline script:
```bash
$ bash AI_ML.sh
```

- Script execution screen is as follows, the container will be created automatically, the GPU burn program will be executed, and the container will be deleted automatically.
