# TWCC FAQs |  Cloud Object Storage(COS)

:::spoiler Q1. Can the data stored in the Cloud Object Storage in the old plan be directly used in the new plan?
:::info
Terribly sorry! Currently TWCC does not provide a service for directly transferring data stored in Cloud Object Storage to another project. You can use third-party software to download the old project data to the local host, and then upload the data from the local host to the Cloud Object Storage of the new project. Please refer to [<ins>this file<ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/howto-project-data-transfer-en) for detailed operation methods.

:::spoiler Q2. Why did I fail to download files on the TWCC webpage?
:::info

The TWCC webpage has a traffic limit, and a single file upload or download cannot exceed 1 GB.
Please confirm your file size. If you need to download a large file, we recommend that you download it through a third-party software (e.g., S3 Browser).
