# HowTo：Initialize the disk- Linux

If you need to increase the storage space after creating the VCS instance, create a new data disk via virtual disk service, and attach the disk to the target VCS instance. Furthermore, you have to initialize the data disk whether in Windows or Linux operating system, then the VCS instance will detect the storage space you have mounted to store the data.

We will explain how to initialize your new data disk.

### Step 1. Make sure that the disk has attached to the VCS instance

After [Attach the data disk to the VCS instance](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/guide-vcs-vds-manage-disk-en#%E9%80%A3%E7%B5%90%E8%87%B3%E8%99%9B%E6%93%AC%E9%81%8B%E7%AE%97%E5%80%8B%E9%AB%94), make sure that it is correctly attached and obtain the mount path (for example: `/dev/vdb`) on TWCC Portal.

[Connect to the VCS instance](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/vcs-guide-connect-to-linux-from-windows-en), enter the following command to make sure that the disk is attached to the instance, and check the disk details to make sure that the path and size are correct.

```
$ sudo fdisk -l
```

### Step 2. Format the disk

Enter the following formatting commands to create a file system that can be used by the VCS instance.


```
$ sudo mkfs -t ext4 <DISK_DEVICE>
```

:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** 
- `<DISK_DEVICE>`: Disk device such as `/dev/vdb`
:::

### Step 3. Mount the disk

Create a directory to mount the disk.


```
$ sudo mkdir <DIRECTORY>
```
:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** 
- `<DIRECTORY>`: Directory path such as `/home/test`
:::

Mount the disk to the directory.

```
$ sudo mount <DISK_DEVICE> <DIRECTORY>
```

### Step 4. Check the mount state

Use the following command to check whether the disk has been successfully mounted to the directory, if there is no problem, you can start to store the data to the new disk.


```
$ df -h
```
