## Related Services

Virtual Disk Service (VDS) is used in many functions related to Virtual Compute Service (VCS):


### Storage space of VCS instances

- **System disk**
We provide a system disk with a built-in 100 GB hard disk drive (HDD) in a VCS instance.

- **Data disk**
VCS instances could mount multiple data disks to expand the storage. TWCC provides two storage options: solid-state drive (SSD) and hard disk drive (HDD)
    - **Solid-state drive (SSD)**:
        - Provides low-latency services (less than 10 milliseconds) and efficient and stable transfers (from 3 IOPS/GB to 16 IOPS/GB) to enhance the reliability and scalability of applications. It is suitable for enterprise applications and computing with big data.
        - Provides a maximum transfer capacity of 2,375 MB/sec for each VCS instance.
        - Supports up to 16 TB of storage space.
    - **Hard disk drive (HDD)**:
        - Provides transfer capacity of 250 MB/sec per TB, suitable for mass data that is not frequently accessed and is unaffected by delay time.
        - Provides a maximum transfer capacity of 2,375 MB/sec for each VCS instance.
        - Supports up to 16 TB of storage space.
   
### Back up the instances and disks

TWCC provides the snapshots that store the backup of images and data disks of VCS instances.
