# Monitoring instance

The TWCC portal can monitor the information of Virtual Compute Service(VCS) instance, including **CPU Utilization**, **Memory Utilization**, **Disk Reads** and **Network Out**.

:::info
{%hackmd @docsharedstyle/note-en %}
- For the difference of permissions in VCS instance between Tenant Admin and Tenant User, see [<ins>User roles and permissions</ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/role-main-en/https%3A%2F%2Fman.twcc.ai%2F%40twccdocs%2Frole-compute-en#虛擬運算服務) for more information.
- TWCC CLI currently does not support this feature.

## Basic View

- Go to the **VCS Instance Management** page, and select a instance.

- Select the "**Monitoring**" tab on the "**VCS Instance Details**" page to monitor instance information:
    - **CPU Utilization(%)**: If the CPU Utilization Rate is displayed as 2 (200%), it means that 2 CPU resources are used up.
    - **Memory Utilization(MB)**: Memory usage, in Megabytes (MB).
    - **Disk Reads(B/s)**: View the read/write rate of each disk in Bytes/second (B/s).
    - **Network Out(B)**: The network traffic of the input/output of the VCS instance is a combination of east-west traffic (horizontal transmission between virtual computing units) and north-south traffic (traffic between the client and the individual). The unit is Bytes (B).

:::info
{%hackmd @docsharedstyle/note-en %}

The network traffic of the TWCC portal includes the sum of the east-west traffic and the north-south traffic, while the quota usage and resource usage records of the  [<ins>Member Center <i class="fa fa-question-circle fa-question-circle-for-service" aria-hidden="true"></i></ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twsdocs/howto-service-access-service-en)  only show the north-south traffic.

## Advanced operation

-Move the cursor to the green dot to get the actual amount.
-Move the cursor to any monitoring map, click the <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-o-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> icon to download the monitoring map file (`. png`) .
-In the right menu, you can select the time, and you can observe the changes in the container resource usage within a specific time period.
