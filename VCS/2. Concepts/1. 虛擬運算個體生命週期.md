# VCS instance lifecycle

Actions performed on the VCS instances via portal or instance, such as create, stop, start, shut down, restart and delete, are closly related to instance life state, instance resources, data, and billing. It also affects connection, image, load balancing, auto scaling, disk and other related services. In this document, we will explain the relationship between the lifecycle state, meaning and billing of a VCS instance from creation to deletion.



- The action and the VCS instance state:

- The relationship between instance state, instance description and usage billing is shown in the following table:

| Instance state | Instance description |usage billing | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `Starting`     |The instacne is preparing to enter  `Ready` state.<br> (1) Create the instance: the system is allocating resources and initializing the instance<br> (2) Start the instance in `Stopped` state: starting <br> (3) Start the instance in `Shutdown` state: starting| Except (3) will be billed, (1), (2) are not billed     | 
| `Ready`     | The initialization has been completed, and the instance can be connected and used normally.|Billed     | 
| `Stopping`   |Instance resources are being released, preparing to enter in `Stopped` state | Billed    | 
| `Stopped`    |Click stop on portal, and the instance enters in `Stopped` state (shutdown and computing resources have been released), and you can click start on portal again to re-allocate resources. | Not billed|
| `Shutdown`    |After executing the shutdown command in the instance, the instance will enter in `Shutdown` state, and it can be restarted by clicking start on portal. | Billed| 
| `Queueing`     | The system is allocating resources . After obtaining the resources, the instance will enter in`Starting` state.|Not billed    | 
| `Deleting`     | The instance is being deleted and will be permanently deleted.|Billed until the instance is successfully deleted     | 

## Create a VCS instance
When you create a VCS instance, the system allocates resources and initializes the instance, and the instance enters in **`Starting`** state which still cannot be used. Wait for entering in **`Ready`** state, then you can perform the following actions:


- <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Connect to the instance
- <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Mount/unmount the data disk in the virtual disk
- <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Create the instance image
- <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Create/remove public IP
- <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Attach/detach the auto scaling and the load balancing

:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** For creation steps, see [<ins> Create VCS instance</ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/guide-vcs-create-en).
:::

## Stop VCS instance
If you plan to not use the instance for a period of time and want to keep the resources, you can click stop to shut down and reclaim the instance resources. The instance will enter in **`Stopping`** state, and ready to enter in **`Stopped`** state which the resources have been released. Under **`Stopped`** state, <ins>**instances will no longer be billed**</ins>. The operating restrictions are as follows:


- <i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> Connect to the instance
- <i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> Create/remove public IP
- <i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> Mount/unmount the data disk in the virtual disk
- <i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> Create the instance image
- <i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> Attach/detach the auto scaling and the load balancing

:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:**  
1. After stopping, the system will **release** instance resources, including GPU, CPU, vCPU, memory and system disk.
2. After stopping, the system will **reserve** the public IP, data disk, auto acaling, and load balancing. The above resources will be automatically linked back to the instance after restarting.
3. All data stored in the instance will be retained except for the data in the memory.
4. For stopping the instance, see [<ins>Stop VCS instance</ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/vcs-guide-manage-instance-en#%E5%81%9C%E6%AD%A2%E5%80%8B%E9%AB%94).
:::

## Restart VCS instance

Click start to restore and use the stopped instance, then the instance will enter in **`Starting`** state. The system is re-allocating the resources, then the instance is ready to enter **`Ready`** state again.
:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:**  
1. Most of the instances that stop and restart will be created on the new physical host.
2. For starting the instance, see [<ins>Restart VCS instance</ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/vcs-guide-manage-instance-en#%E9%87%8D%E5%95%9F%E5%80%8B%E9%AB%94).

## Shut down VCS instance

After the shutdown command is executed, the instance will enter in **`Shutdown`** state. In the **`Shutdown`** state, <ins>**the instance will continue to be billed**</ins>.

The operating restrictions are as follows:

- <i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> Connect to the instance
- <i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> Create/remove public IP
- <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Mount/unmount the data disk in the virtual disk
- <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Create the instance image
- <i class="fa fa-times" aria-hidden="true"></i> Attach/detach the auto scaling and the load balancing

:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:** 
- Unlike [<ins>Stop VCS instance</ins>](#Stop-VCS-instance), after shutting down, the system will clear the memory data, and **the resources are not released back to the resource pool**. All stored data are retained and can be used after restarting.
- For shutdown steps, see [<ins>Shut down VCS instance</ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/vcs-guide-manage-instance-en#%E5%88%AA%E9%99%A4%E5%80%8B%E9%AB%94).
:::

## Restart VCS instance

If you want to restart instance that has been shut down, click start then the instance will enter **`Starting`** state, which means that it is booting, and preparing enter **`Ready`** state again.


:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:**  For restarting the instance, see [<ins>Restart VCS instance</ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/concept-vcs-lifecycle-en#%E5%80%8B%E9%AB%94%E9%87%8D%E9%96%8B%E6%A9%9F).
:::

## Delete VCS instance

If you want to delete the instance permanently and no longer use it, click delete then the instance will enter **`Deleting`** state. <ins>**After the instance is successfully deleted, it will no longer be billed**</ins>, and disappeared from the instance list. Other notices for deletion:

- The data in the operating system disk (system disk) will also be deleted permanently. You can create an image to keep those data.
- The data disk will be automatically detached and kept

:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note:**  For deleting the instance, see [<ins>Delete VCS instance</ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/vcs-guide-manage-instance-en#%E5%88%AA%E9%99%A4%E5%80%8B%E9%AB%94).
