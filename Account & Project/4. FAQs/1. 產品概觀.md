# TWCC FAQs | Service Overview

:::spoiler Q1. What's the difference between Container Compute Service (CCS), Virtual Compute Service (VCS) and High-performance Computing (HPC)?

:::info
The functions and features, resource specifications, and storage space of these three services:

| Service       | Container Compute Service (CCS)                                                       | Virtual Compute Service (VCS)                                                     | High-performance Computing (HPC) |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Function and Feature | ● Train predict and AI Model<br>● Adjust parameters at any time, easy to develop<br>● Fixed resource options | ● Similar to general virtual machine, suitable for setting up a server<br>● Adjustable network and security settings<br>● Fixed resource options | ● Cross compute nodes<br>● Command Line UI<br>● Flexible selection of the number of GPUs          |
| Resource specification   | ● Up to 8 GPUs can be used<br>● Resource ratio of GPU:CPU:RAM(GB) is 1:4:90              | ● provide vCPU, Up to 48 cores can be used                                                                   | ● Flexible selection of the number of GPUs|
| Storage space   | ● Sign up an account to get 200 GB of Hyper File System (HFS), you can purchase more space according to your needs        | ● Boot Disk (100 GB)<br>● Virtual Disk Service(VDS) attach data disk. It's capacity can be decided by users.                                                                   | ● Sign up an account to get 200 GB of Hyper File System (HFS), you can purchase more space according to your needs          |

:::spoiler Q2. What's the difference between Hyper File System (HFS), Virtual Disk Service (VDS) and Cloud Object Storage (COS)?

:::info

The comparison of the computing services, price and data transfer of these three services:


| Service | Hyper File System (HFS) | Virtual Disk Service (VDS)     | Cloud Object Storage (COS) |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Attached computing service | ● Container Compute Service (CCS)<br>● High-performance Computing (HPC)<br> | ● Virtual Compute Service (VCS)<br> | ● Transfer data through TWCC CLI, CCS and VCS        |
| Price | High | Medium | Low |
|Data transfer | ● Upload and download the files using SFTP<br> ● Transfer data through TWCC CLI and COS | ● Transfer data through TWCC CLI and COS <br> ● Connect VCS through SSH, then attach and initialize the virtual disk. Upload and download the files using SFTP| ● Upload and download the files using third-party software |

:::spoiler Q3. What kind of scenarios are applicable for Container Compute Service (CCS) and Virtual Compute Service (VCS)?

:::info
- Container Compute Service (CCS) is suitable for Large-scale, data-intensive high load operation, e.g.Training AI model.
- Virtual Compute Service (VCS) is suitable for low load operation, e.g. Build a website, predict service of AI model.
