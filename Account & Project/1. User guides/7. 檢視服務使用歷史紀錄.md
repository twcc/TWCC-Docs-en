# View service usage history

The service functions you use on the TWCC portal and TWCC CLI are all by calling the TWCC API to complete various tasks. The [service operations history](#Service-Operation-History) can be viewed on the TWCC portal and [download log file](#Download-Log-File).

You can determine from the history:

- The member who started the job^[1]^
- The method to start the job (`GET`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`POST`/`DELETE`)^[2]^
- Operated on which services
- Job status
- Job response time
