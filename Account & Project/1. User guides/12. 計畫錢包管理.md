# Project wallet management

The Project Creator or administrator (Tenant Admin) can perform wallet management for your project members (Tenant Users) to limit the amount that the members can use during the execution of the project, which helps the Project Creator to effectively manage the usage of project members so as not to overuse the project credit.

**If not specifically set, all members share the credit of the main wallet.**

<i class="fa fa-laptop" aria-hidden="true"></i> Example of sub-wallet management:  a project has applied for 50,000 credits (main wallet)
- Member A is allocated a sub-wallet with 10,000 credits
- Member B is allocated a sub-wallet with 30,000 credits
- The sub-wallets has been allocated for 40,000 credits, so the main wallet has only 10,000 credits left
