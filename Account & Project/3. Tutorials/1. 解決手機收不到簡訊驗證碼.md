# HowTo：Fix cannot receive SMS verification code

In order to indentify user and validity of user's mobile phone, it's necessary to receive the SMS message and enter the verification code to complete the sign up process. 

However, if the following situations occur, the mobile phone may not receive the verification code, please follow the instructions and circumstances to fix with:

### Circumstance 1. Weak cell phone signal
 
- Please confirm that the signal is normal, or resend it later.

### Circumstance 2. Blocking APP in mobile phone 

Blocking APP (e.g. whoscall) block the advertising phone number, or set up a blacklist.

- Since the verification message is sent by the system, the mobile phone is likely to be classified as an advertising number. Please confirm whether the relevant advertising number is blocked to avoid failure of sending the message.

### Circumstance 3. Enable "Reject Enterprise SMS" function

Telecommunications companies provide "Reject Enterprise SMS" service, that altomatically refuse to receive corporate SMS messages, which may result in failure to receive verification code message normally.
- Take Chunghwa Telecom as an example (see the picture below), log in [emome](https://www.emome.net/) website, and click on 「**我的 emome(my emome)**」>「**申請服務(Apply for service)**」中點選「**拒收企業簡訊(Reject Enterprise SMS)**」, confirm whether this service is in the status of "**disable**". If you have already applied for it, it may cause the failure to receive verification code message normally.
- If you are not familiar with the process steps, call the customer service of your telecommunications company and complete the requirement through voice service.

### Circumstance 4. An exception in setting up the messenger app on the phone

Because of the different settings of mobile phone brands, there may be multiple apps that receive text messages (such as Google Messages, Facebook Messenger, or other text messaging software) in the phone at the same time. However, there can be only one APP that receive messages, so the setting may be changed during the system update or an exception occurs. 

- Make sure the APP has been updated to the latest version, and clear cache/data. 
- Take the Android 7.0 mobile phone as an example,   "**Clear Data**" and "**Clear Cache**" of the APP you receive the text messages, and make sure to use only one single APP to receive the SMS to avoid multiple receiving at the same time.

### Circumstance 5. Exceed the sending quota of the day

- There is a limit of three times per day (calculated in days, not in 24-hour ) in the Green Point App. Please try again the next day.
