# HowTo：Resolve cannot receive SMS verification code

In order to verify your identity and phone number, you need to enter the verification code received via SMS message to complete the sign-up process.

However, if the following situations occur, the mobile phone may not receive the verification code, please follow the instructions according to your circumstance to resolve with:

### Circumstance 1. Weak cell phone signal
 
- Please make sure that the signal is normal, or resend it later.

### Circumstance 2. Blocking apps on your mobile phone 

Blocking app (e.g. whoscall) block the advertising phone number, or set up a blacklist.

- Since the verification message is sent by the system, the mobile phone is likely to be classified as an advertising number. Please confirm whether the relevant advertising number is blocked to avoid failure of sending the message.

### Circumstance 3. Enable "Reject Enterprise SMS" function

Telecommunications companies provide "Reject Enterprise SMS" services, that automatically refuse to receive corporate SMS messages, which may result in failure to receive the verification code message normally.
- Take Chunghwa Telecom as an example (as shown in the figure below), log in [emome](https://www.emome.net/) website, and click 「**我的 emome(my emome)**」>「**申請服務(Apply for service)**」> then click「**拒收企業簡訊(Reject Enterprise SMS)**」, and make sure this service is "**disabled**". If you have already applied for it, it may cause your cell phone not to receive the verification code message normally.
- If you are unfamiliar with the process, call the customer service of your telecommunications company and complete the change through voice service.

### Circumstance 4. An exception in setting up the messenger app on the phone

Because of the different settings of mobile phone brands, there may be multiple apps that receive text messages (such as Google Messages, Facebook Messenger, or other text messaging apps) in the mobile phone at the same time. However, there can be only one app that receive messages, so the setting might be changed during the system update or an exception occurs. 

- Make sure the app has been updated to the latest version, and clear memory cache. 
- Take the Android 7.0 mobile phone as an example,   "**Clear Data**" and "**Clear Cache**" of the app you receive the text messages, and make sure to use only one single app to receive the SMS to avoid multiple receiving at the same time.

==**Need to update:exclamation:**==

### Circumstance 5. Exceed the sending quota of the day

- There is a limit of three times per day (calculated in days, not in 24-hour ) in the Green Point App. Please try again the next day.
