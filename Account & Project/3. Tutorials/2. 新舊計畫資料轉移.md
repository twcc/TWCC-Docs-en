# HowTo：Transfer data from old project to new project

:::success
<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Scenario：How to transfer data from old project to new project?**

*Do you have question about transferring data? Let us show you how to connect TWCC cloud services step by step to answer your question !*
:::

If you already applied for new project and hope that the data from old project can be continuously used, please refer to this documentation. Transfer your data through **Cloud Object Storage (COS)**.


**Sequence of data transferring：Old project COS** <i class="fa fa-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> Download to **Localhost** <i class="fa fa-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i> Upload to **New project COS**


According to your operating system, refer to [Localhost in Windows](#Localhost-in-Windows) or [Localhost in Linux](#Localhost-in-Linux).

:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note：** Hyper File System (HFS) is attached to the user account, rather than project. Therefore, the data in HFS storage space does not need to transfer, and could still be accessed in the new project.
:::


## Localhost in Windows

### Step 1. Back up the old project data to COS

For those who use Virtual Compute Service (VCS), please refer to [this doc](https://www.twcc.ai/doc?page=backup). Back up the old project data in VCS Instance to COS.

:::info
<i class="fa fa-paperclip fa-20" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Note：** 
The default compute resource of Container Compute Service (CCS) and Taiwania 2 is Hyper File System (HFS), and personal data can be used cross projects. Therefore,  this step can be skipped.
:::

### Step 2. Connect old project COS with localhost S3 Browser

After back up, please download S3 browser to your local, and connect with COSs of your old project and new project.

### Step 3. Download the old project data to local

S3 browser does not support direct data transfer, please select the file you need to transfer and download it to  local.

### Step 2. Connect old project COS with localhost

Please refer to [this doc ](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/cosbackup-en#%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%9D%E8%88%87%E8%A8%AD%E5%AE%9A-s3cmd)to install s3cmd, enter **Old project data (Access Key、Secret Key)**. Connect old project COS with localhost through s3cmd.

### Step 3. Download the Old project data to local

Enter the following command to download old project data to local.

```bash
$ s3cmd get --recursive s3://<BUCKET_NAME>/<FOLDER_NAME or FILE_NAME> <LOCAL_DIR>
```

### Step 4. Connect New project COS with localhost

Enter command `s3cmd --configure` again, and enter related information to connect with New project COS.

### Step 5. Upload the data to New project

Upload the local data to the COS of new project. We're done!

```bash
$ s3cmd put  --recursive <LOCAL_FILE_NAME> s3://<BUCKET_NAME>
```
