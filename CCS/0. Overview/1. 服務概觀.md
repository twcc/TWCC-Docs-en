## Container Compute Service (CCS) makes you deploy the environment of GPU processor faster and improve the work efficiency!

Interactive Container enables you to deploy development environment quickly, choose different AI frameworks on demand, and edit script directly through the built-in Jupyter Notebook. Container service attach Hyper File System (HFS) automatically, also, Users can use Cloud Object Storage(COS) in container by themselves to store training data and models.

Container Compute Service can be created through TWCC portal, API, CLI (Command Line Interface). Different from the traditional use of supercomputer resources, which can only be operated by CLI, TWCC allows you to freely choose the interface you are familiar with to connect applications easily.

We use Kubernetes framework and import Nvidia that optimizes AI software connection to build a world-class virtualization technology. You can deploy development environment at short notice. Compared to the traditional way, it can save 3 times of time-cost and enable users flexibly switch platforms.

Offering many AI frameworks that optimized by Nvidia (e.g., TensorFlow, Caffe, CUDA, Torch, PyTorch, TensorRT, TensorRT Server, CNTK, MXNet, Theano, DIGITS, RAPIDS). Users do not need to worry about installation, and can meet the different needs of model training and inference.

- Interactive container can be used with programming, online debugging and computing using Jupyter Notebook. Even mobile devices can complete the tasks to keep track of the work progress at any time.
- Scheduled container can be used with reserving the execution time, scheduling and planning the amount of resources used by batch tasks to improve work efficiency. The computing resources are recovered after computing, effectively saving development costs.

Providing high-throughput Hyper File System(HFS) to accelerate computing, and can also use Cloud Object Storage(COS) to store data safely without worrying data lost.

- The tenant isolation network architecture is safe for use.
- Kubernetes frequently upgrades its containers and optimizes their functions.
- HPC Hyper-Converged Infrastructure(HCI) for Kubernetes. Develop using GPU Container. Massively deploy to HPC and perform cross-node parallel computing.
