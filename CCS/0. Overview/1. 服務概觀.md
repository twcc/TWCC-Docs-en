## Container Compute Service (CCS) enables you deploy the environment of GPU processor faster and improve your work efficiency!

Interactive Container enables you to deploy development environment quickly, choose different AI frameworks on demand, and edit script directly through the built-in Jupyter Notebook. Container service is mounted with Hyper File System (HFS) automatically. Also, users can use Cloud Object Storage(COS) in containers by themselves to store training data and models.

Container Compute Service can be created through TWCC portal, API, CLI (command-line interface). Different from the traditional use of supercomputer resources, which can only be operated with CLI, TWCC allows you to freely choose the interface you are familiar with to build your application stack easily.

We use the Kubernetes framework, import Nvidia optimized AI software, making connections to world-class virtualization technology. You can deploy development environment at short notice. Compared to the traditional way, it can save 3 times of time-cost and enable users flexibly switch platforms.

Offering many AI frameworks that optimized by Nvidia (e.g., TensorFlow, Caffe, CUDA, Torch, PyTorch, TensorRT, TensorRT Server, CNTK, MXNet, Theano, DIGITS, RAPIDS). Users do not need to worry about installation, and can meet the different needs of model training and inference.

- Interactive container can be used with programming, online debugging and computing using Jupyter Notebook. Even mobile devices can complete the tasks to keep track of the work progress at any time.
- Scheduled container can be used with reserving the execution time, scheduling and planning the amount of resources used by batch tasks to improve work efficiency. The computing resources are recovered after computing, effectively saving development costs.

Providing high-throughput Hyper File System (HFS) to accelerate computing, and can also use Cloud Object Storage(COS) to store data safely without worrying data lost.

- Network structured for tenant isolation makes it safe to use.
- Functions are constantly optimized with Kubernetes rolling updates.
- With Kubernetes and HPC hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) , GPU containers for application development have the capability to allocate resources in HPC for parallel computing.
