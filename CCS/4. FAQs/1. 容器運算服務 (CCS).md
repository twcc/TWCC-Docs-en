:::spoiler Q2. Can I create a container for others to use?

:::info
When creating a container for others to use, you need to consider the following points:

* Your supercomputer password must be provided to others to connect to the container.
* /home and /work directory are your personal HFS storage space. Others may damage or lose the data in these two folders when used by others. Even if you open a new container, these changes cannot be restored.
* Sharing computing resources will bring out data security risks, please consider carefully.

Therefore, in addition to creating containers for others, you can also use [<ins>Member Center <i class="fa fa-question-circle fa-question-circle-for-service" aria-hidden="true"></i></ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/doc-service-main-zh/https%3A%2F%2Fman.twcc.ai%2F%40twsdocs%2Fhowto-service-access-service-zh), adding others to the plan, the user can use the container resources on his own.

:::spoiler Q4. Do you charge for the container once it is created, or do you charge when it is computing?

:::info
Once a container is created, it starts to occupy computing resources, so after it is created, before you delete the container, you will continue to be billed.
