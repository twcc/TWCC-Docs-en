# Interactive container service life cycle

The user's execution to Interactive container-creation and deletion, the status of the resulted container is closely related to resources, data, and billing. This article will explain in detail all the relationships between life cycle states, meanings, and billing of the container from creation to deletion

The transition between the execution action and the container state:

- The relationship between container status, description and usage billing is shown in the following table:

| Container status | Status description |Container usage billing | 
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| `Initializing`     | Enter `Ready` status.<br> Create the container: the system is allocating resources and initializing the container<br>| free of charge     | 
| `Ready`     | The initialization has been completed, and the container can be connected and used normally|charge     | 
| `Deleting`     | Delete the container, the container will be permanently deleted|free of charge         | 


## Create a container

After the container is created, the system will allocate resources and initialize the execution container, the container status will show **`Initializing`**. At this time still cannot be used, but will enter **`Ready`** status soon. Once 
enter **`Ready`** status, the operable content is as follows:

- <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Login
- <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Create container image
- <i class="fa fa-check" aria-hidden="true"></i> Associate, dissociate service ports... and other operations

## Delete a container

If you want to delete a container permanently and no longer use it, after clicking delete, the container status will appear **`Deleting`**, <ins>**billing will not be counted anymore**</ins>. After the deletion is complete, the container will disappear from the list.

Notice of deletion:
- The data in the container system directory will be permanently deleted. If you need to keep it, you can create [Container Image](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/guide-ccs-duplicate-en).
- /home, /work data (Hyper File System storage space) will be retained and will not be removed as the container is deleted.
