TWCC provides a total of 20 ready-to-use developing environments with NGC optimized TensorFlow. TensorFlow is an open source code library that uses data flow charts to express abstract numerical operations. In the flowchart, nodes represent mathematical operations, and edges represent multi-dimensional data arrays connecting nodes, also known as tensors. The flexible architecture design can easily operate on different devices, such as one or more CPU/GPU of a PC, smart mobile devices and so on.

Those with the same version number but distinguishing `tf2` and `tf1` are TensorFlow version differences; distinguishing `py3` and `py2` are Python version differences.
