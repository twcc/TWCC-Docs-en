# HowTo : Add Python 3 kernel to Jupyter Notebook 

:::success
<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Scenario：I'm used to use Python 3, but there's only Python 2 in Jupyter Notebook...**

*Do you have the same problem? Let us show you how to integrate TWCC services to solve the problems you are facing with!*
:::

TWCC Interactive Container provides Jupyter Notebook by default. It is a web-based integrated development environment to write scripts, display output, visualize data... and many other functions, and can install multiple computing kernels of programming languages according to needs. 

In some of TWCC container images (such as `caffe-19.08-py2:latest`), it only provides Python 2 kernel in Jupyter Notebook (as shown in the figure below). We will show you how to add Python 3 Kernel to create a convenient computing environment!

## Step 1. Launch Interactive Container

Please refer to [<ins>Launch the container</ins>](https://man.twcc.ai/@twccdocs/SJlZnSOaN?type=view#%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-Jupyter-Notebook) to launch your Interactive Container.


## Step 2. Install Python 3 Kernel

Switch  to root user and install Python 3 kernel: 

```bash
$ sudo su 
$ apt-get update     
$ apt-get install python3-pip
$ python3 -m pip install ipykernel  
$ python3 -m ipykernel install
```

## Step 3. Make sure that the installation is complete

Refresh the Jupyter Notebook page, click "**New**" in the upper right corner, make sure that Python 2 and Python 3 are available, we're done!
